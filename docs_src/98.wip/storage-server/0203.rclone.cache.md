Rclone has a (beta) documented [cache](https://rclone.org/cache/) functionality which "wraps another existing remote and stores file structure and its data for long running tasks like `rclone mount`".

We'll use this to create the archive tier of our storage solution. The resulting folder structure will look like this.

```bash
/mnt/local/downloads # <-- becomes the cache
/mnt/local/Media
/mnt/local/transcodes
/mnt/remote/downloads # <-- becomes the remote
/mnt/remote/Media
/mnt/remote/transcodes
```

As per the docs

>During testing, I experienced a lot of bans with the remotes in this order. I suspect it might be related to how crypt opens files on the cloud provider which makes it think weâ€™re downloading the full file instead of small chunks. Organizing the remotes in this order yields better results: `cloud remote -> cache -> crypt`.

They also specify in the [file-caching](https://rclone.org/commands/rclone_mount/#file-caching) section that.

>the VFS cache works in addition to the cache backend and you may find that you need one or the other or both.
>... This may be appropriate for your needs, or you may prefer to look at the cache backend which does a much more sophisticated job of caching, including caching directory hierarchies and chunks of files.
