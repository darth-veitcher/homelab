As described in the official kubernetes [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) an `Ingress` object manages external access to services in a cluster, typically HTTP. They can provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting.

The easiest way to get setup with one is via [Helm](https://helm.sh) and we'll use the [Nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) ingress for the moment.

Install helm
```bash
# Live on the edge
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/master/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

Add the stable repo
```bash
helm repo add stable https://kubernetes-charts.storage.googleapis.com/
```

Now install the ingress.
```bash
helm install my-ingress stable/nginx-ingress \
    --set controller.kind=DaemonSet \
    --set controller.service.type=LoadBalancer \
    --set controller.hostNetwork=true
```

To check that all pods are running.
```bash
$ kubectl get pod -l 'app=nginx-ingress'

NAME                                                        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller-n7mt6                   1/1     Running   0          3m17s
my-ingress-nginx-ingress-default-backend-7469774fb6-wlxjh   1/1     Running   0          3m17s
```

<!-- #TODO: Need to check impact of `LoadBalancer` vs `NodePort` -->
As we deployed the ingress with both `DaemonSet` and `hostNetwork=true` these controllers will exist on every node in the cluster and be listening on the host ports of `80` and `443`. Editing one will show this.

```bash hl_lines="12 15 16 19 20"
$ kubectl edit pod my-ingress-nginx-ingress-controller-n7mt6

...
affinity:
    nodeAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
        nodeSelectorTerms:
        - matchFields:
          - key: metadata.name
            operator: In
            values:
            - banks.local
...

- containerPort: 80
    hostPort: 80
    name: http
    protocol: TCP
- containerPort: 443
    hostPort: 443
    name: https
    protocol: TCP
```

<!-- #TODO: Edit firewall on nodes to allow 443 and 80 -->

# Deploy sample application
Let's try to expose an application now via this ingress controlller.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ingress; \
cd ~/ingress
```

First, create the deployment and associated service. **Notice how we don't use `LoadBalancer` as the type.**
```yaml
# file: ~/ingress/example/whoami.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: whoami-deployment
  labels:
    app: whoami
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: whoami
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: whoami
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: whoami
        image: containous/whoami
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami
spec:
  # type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: whoami
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Apply with `kubectl apply -f ~/ingress/example/whoami.yaml`.

We can now configure the ingress controller to route requests to this service. We'll use `localhost` for the moment to avoid any DNS setting requirements and just prove the routing works. As you can see from the comment this should change to the `fqdn` of the service ultimately.

```yaml
# file: ~/ingress/example/whoami-ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: whoami-ingress
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    kubernete.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - host: localhost  # whoami.jamesveitch.dev
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: whoami
          servicePort: 80
```

Apply with `kubectl apply -f ~/ingress/example/whoami-ingress.yaml`.

Now, running a `curl` from the node should give you something similar to the following.

```bash
$ curl localhost

Hostname: whoami-deployment-5b4bb9c787-zsv2h
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 10.244.204.200
RemoteAddr: 192.168.0.104:45478
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
Accept: */*
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-Host: localhost
X-Forwarded-Port: 80
X-Forwarded-Proto: http
X-Real-Ip: 127.0.0.1
X-Request-Id: 678701531703cebe524d5803dd28d08b
X-Scheme: http
```

# Teardown
Remove the ingress resource and `whoami` application.

```bash
kubectl delete -f ~/ingress/example/whoami-ingress.yaml; \
kubectl delete -f ~/ingress/example/whoami.yaml
```
