Navigating to the [addons](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/) link provided above will show that we've got some options available. First we will focus on the `Networking and Network Policy` where we will use Canal as a CNI (networking solution between pods). Canal unites Flannel and Calico, providing networking and network policy.

# Canal
Most of these manifests can be found in the [official GitHub repo](https://github.com/projectcalico/calico) if required.

```bash
# Role-based access control (RBAC)
# Kubernetes API datastore with flannel networking:
# https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.10/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/integration#role-based-access-control-rbac

kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.10/manifests/rbac/rbac-kdd-flannel.yaml

# Installing Calico for policy and flannel for networking
# Installing with the Kubernetes API datastore (recommended)
# We can install directly as we're using the pod CIDR 10.244.0.0/16
# https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.10/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/flannel

kubectl apply -f https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.10/manifests/canal.yaml
```

???+ info "Network Interfaces"
    Checking the available network interfaces should now show something similar to the below. You'll have a number of `cali*` interfaces, each one per pod.

    ![network](../../00.architecture/network.k8s.drawio.svg)

    ```bash
    $ networkctl list

    IDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP

# Pure Calico
```bash
mkdir -p ~/calico; \
cd ~/calico; \
wget https://docs.projectcalico.org/v3.10/manifests/calico.yaml

export POD_CIDR=10.244.0.0/16; \
sed -i -e "s?192.168.0.0/16?$POD_CIDR?g" calico.yaml

kubectl apply -f ~/calico/calico.yaml
```

???+ info "Network Interfaces"
    Checking the available network interfaces should now show something similar to the below. You'll have a number of `cali*` interfaces, each one per pod. The main difference is a `tunl0` as opposed to `flannel.1`.

    ```bash hl_lines="12"
    $ networkctl list

    IDX LINK             TYPE               OPERATIONAL SETUP
