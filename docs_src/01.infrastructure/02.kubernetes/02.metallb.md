When you run Kubernetes services on supported cloud providers (GCP, AWS, Azure) obtaining an externally adressable endpoint for those you'd like to expose is abstracted away behind a call to a `LoadBalancer` in their infrastructre. This provisions an IP address and routes it to your service.

As we're running on-prem or in our own cloud configuration we don't have this luxury. Luckily, someone at Google also likes bare metal... and so they created [MetalLB](https://metallb.universe.tf) as an alternative implementation of this functionality.

>MetalLB is a load-balancer implementation for bare metal Kubernetes clusters, using standard routing protocols.

Install MetalLB per the [docs](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/)
```bash
export METALLB_VERSION=v0.8.3

mkdir -p ~/metallb; \
cd ~/metallb

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/metallb/${METALLB_VERSION}/manifests/metallb.yaml; \
kubectl apply -f ~/metallb/metallb.yaml
```

Create a configmap that allocates a valid address range on your local network which MetalLB will then hand out.
```yaml
# file: ~/metallb/config.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: metallb-system
  name: config
data:
  config: |
    address-pools:
    - name: default
      protocol: layer2
      addresses:
      - 192.168.0.200-192.168.0.250
```

Apply this now with `kubectl apply -f ~/metallb/config.yaml`.

# Sample deployment
We'll now deploy a simple `whoami` container and tell MetalLB to give it an external IP address from the cluster internal network. Further information on `Service` objects in kubernetes can be found in the [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/), specifically the [Publishing Services (ServiceTypes)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types) section.

```yaml
# file: ~/metallb/example/whoami.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: whoami-deployment
  labels:
    app: whoami
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: whoami
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: whoami
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: whoami
        image: containous/whoami
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: whoami
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

Run `kubectl apply -f ~/metallb/example/whoami.yaml` to create the deployment and associated service. You should now be able to see a service `whoami` of type `LoadBalancer` being created and having an `EXTERNAL-IP` allocated to it by MetalLB.
```bash
$ kubectl get svc

NAME         TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP     PORT(S)        AGE
kubernetes   ClusterIP      10.96.0.1      <none>          443/TCP        13h
whoami       LoadBalancer   10.96.99.249   192.168.0.201   80:31314/TCP   8m47s
```

You can query this as well with curl to confirm.
```bash
$ curl 192.168.0.201

Hostname: whoami-deployment-5b4bb9c787-fmb77
IP: 127.0.0.1
IP: 192.168.204.231
RemoteAddr: 192.168.0.102:20516
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.201
User-Agent: curl/7.58.0
Accept: */*
```

The interesting pieces above are the IPs in the hops.

* `IP: 127.0.0.1`: localhost
* `IP: 192.168.204.231`: an address on the subnet of the Calico CNI `tunl0`. You could access the pod directly using this as well if on the same network (pod to pod communication).
* `RemoteAddr: 192.168.0.102:20516`: the client making the request (us, on the master node using curl).
* `Host: 192.168.0.201`: the address allocated to the service by MetalLB, now accessible from anyone on the LAN.

You can see some of this by running a `describe` on the pod with `kubectl describe pod -l 'app=whoami'`. This will show both the `Node` and assigned `IP` as well as the associated CNI `annotation` that allows Calico to route packets.

Reviewing the service with `kubectl describe svc whoami` gives similarly useful information.
