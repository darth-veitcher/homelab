We're going to install the [ExternalDNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) addon for Kubernetes in order to make our services discoverable externally via public DNS.

>... it retrieves a list of resources (Services, Ingresses, etc.) from the Kubernetes API to determine a desired list of DNS records.

So it uses annotations inside Kubernetes in order to identify the services you;d like to expose.

>... allows you to control DNS records dynamically via Kubernetes resources in a DNS provider-agnostic way.

And then, using these annotations, will configure an external DNS provider of your choice to populate the necessary records to expose your services.

At time of writing the current version is `v0.5`. This provides `Beta` support for `Cloudflare`. The [Setting up ExternalDNS for Services on Cloudflare](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/cloudflare.md) tutorial will be used as a starting point. Because though we're using an ingress we will need to adapt it slightly to use an `ingress` as opposed to `service`.

# Cloudflare
Login to Cloudflare and generate an API Token. As per the docs:

>When using API Token authentication the token should be granted Zone `Read` and DNS `Edit` privileges
>
>API Token will be preferred for authentication if `CF_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set. Otherwise `CF_API_KEY` and `CF_API_EMAIL` should be set to run ExternalDNS with Cloudflare.

Make note of this token as we'll need it below.

In addition there's an open issue [#1127](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/issues/1127#issuecomment-537069557) which highlights.

>for now, the API token must be granted for all zone, cannot only to a specific zone.

We're going to use [Kubernetes secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) in order to store our api credentials from Cloudflare.

```bash
kubectl create secret generic cloudflare-api-token --from-literal=CF_API_TOKEN=Aq6g43899Am0567SURF2diL2DSZBGEYIAUHdmluaB
```

This should now be encoded and stored. To check, run a describe.
```bash
$ kubectl get secret cloudflare-api-token -o yaml

```bash
# add the token to the manifest template

sed -i.bak 's/{{CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN}}/'${CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN}'/' ~/external-dns/external-dns.yaml

# now apply the manifest
kubectl create -f ~/external-dns/external-dns.yaml
```

As we've set this up to monitor `--source=service` (as opposed to `ingress`) we now need to modify the service manifest for applications we'd like to expose.

Let's modify the `whoami` spec and add the necessary annotations. For those of you who have used [Traefik](https://traefik.io) with Docker or DockerCompose in the past this is a very similar concept.

```yaml hl_lines="5 6 7"
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: whoami
  annotations:
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/hostname: whoami.jamesveitch.dev
    external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/ttl: "120" #optional
spec:
  selector:
    app: whoami
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

kubectl logs -l 'app=external-dns'
