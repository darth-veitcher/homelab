For the Kubernetes ingress node I'm going to use a cheap (<$5 per month) dedicated server from [Kimsufi](https://www.kimsufi.com) which has unmetered traffic and 100mb bandwidth. This will allow me to have a static IP4 address to point my DNS records at whikst then using the internal wireguard VPN to route traffic from here back home / elsewhere.
