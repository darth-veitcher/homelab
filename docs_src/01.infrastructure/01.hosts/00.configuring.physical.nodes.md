# Physical Nodes
I'm going to start with a single node install on a server at home and then, slowly, add additional nodes to create a cluster. I'll `taint` the first node though so that it can run standalone without needing further nodes to operate.

My final configuration will look roughly like this:

* Homelab
    * Server 1: Dell R610, Primary Compute, `asimov`
    * Server 2: Dell R710, Secondary Compute, `banks`
    * Server 3: Custom Build, Primary LAN Storage, `clarke`
* Cloud
    * Dedicated Server 1: Kimsufi, Ingress Node, `donaldson`
    * Dedicated Server 2: Kimsufi, Compute Node, `eesmith`

Between the `Homelab` and `Cloud` I'll run a VPN such that traffic is encrypted and we can bypass the public internet and any associated NAT / routing issues by having the nodes discover each other using VPN subnet addresses.
