# Basic housekeeping
First of all install the latest Ubuntu 18.04 LTS release and copy across your ssh key and then follow some simple hardening steps `#TODO: link to ansible`.

???+ tip "Allow sudo without password (optional)"
    You can allow your user to execute sudo commands without needing a password prompt for ease.

    ```bash
    echo "$USER ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" | sudo tee -a /etc/sudoers > /dev/null
    ```

We'll configure our hostname too in order to reflect whatever the `fqdn` of our server is going to be. In my case this will be `banks.local` as it will just be an internal address. This is used by kubernetes later on.

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname banks.local
```

# Install wireguard
See [Wireguard vs OpenVPN on a local Gigabit Network](https://snikt.net/blog/2018/12/13/wireguard-vs-openvpn-on-a-local-gigabit-network/) for a performance comparison. As wireguard is now incorporated into the linux kernel we can install it on the host nodes and then kubernetes network plugins such as [wormhole](https://github.com/gravitational/wormhole) or [kilo](https://github.com/squat/kilo) can then use the kernel module to configure a dynamic VPN mesh between nodes.

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:wireguard/wireguard; \
sudo apt-get install -y wireguard; \
sudo modprobe wireguard  # activate kernal module
```

???+ check "Check Kernel Module"
    To check if the module is loaded use `lsmod | grep wireguard`. You should see something like the below.

    ```bash
    $ lsmod | grep wireguard

    wireguard             208896  0
    ip6_udp_tunnel         16384  1 wireguard
    udp_tunnel             16384  1 wireguard
    ```

Enable forwarding of packets in the host kernel (there might be a slight delay in reconnecting if doing this over ssh).

```bash
sudo tee /etc/sysctl.conf << EOF
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
EOF
sudo sysctl -p
```

# Enable Avahi (Discovery) on VPN and LAN
As per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avahi_%28software%29).

>Avahi is a free zero-configuration networking (zeroconf) implementation, including a system for multicast DNS/DNS-SD service discovery. It is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
>
>Avahi is a system which enables programs to publish and discover services and hosts running on a local network. For example, a user can plug a computer into a network and have Avahi automatically advertise the network services running on its machine, facilitating user access to those services.

We will setup our nodes to publish themselves on both the LAN (so can be accessed via their hostnames) and VPN (optional).

```bash
# from docker
export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive; \
sudo apt-get update -y; \
sudo apt-get -qq install -y avahi-daemon avahi-utils
```

The main configuration is held in `/etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf`. We can modify the `allow-interfaces` line (to limit which interfaces we advertise on). This will be useful for when we want to only enable it on *internal* interfaces (e.g. our Cloud node shouldn't try and broadcast across the internet). We'll leave this for now.

```bash
# file: /etc/avahi/avahi-daemon.conf
allow-interfaces=bond0, wg0, docker0

# If we're using an internal domain then leave as `local` below, else change to tld
domain-name=local
```

Reload / restart the daemon with `sudo systemctl daemon-reload && sudo systemctl restart avahi-daemon.service`

# Network status
After a vanilla install above, the network configuration and topology looks like the below.

???+ info "Network status"
    ```bash
    $ networkctl list
