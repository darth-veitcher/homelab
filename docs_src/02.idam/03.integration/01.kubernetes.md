There's an excellent article on [Medium](https://medium.com/@mrbobbytables/kubernetes-day-2-operations-authn-authz-with-oidc-and-a-little-help-from-keycloak-de4ea1bdbbe) which partially covers what we're about to do and helped to solidify some of my thoughts. Highly worth a read for some background.

We're going to now integrate our Kubernetes cluster's `Authentication` (identify someone) and `Authorisation` (what they should be able to do) with our Keycloak+OpenLDAP implementation.

Initially I'm going to prove that we should be able to login as `jamesveitch` (my `uid`).

??? tip "LDIF Export: James Veitch"
    Remember we exported the LDIF? If you review the file you'll see the following.
    ```ldif hl_lines="12"
    # Entry 11: cn=James Veitch,ou=People,dc=jamesveitch,dc=dev
    dn: cn=James Veitch,ou=People,dc=jamesveitch,dc=dev
